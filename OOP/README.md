# About Object Oriented Paradigm(OOP)
  - C++ is an object-oriented programming language.
    
      1. Everything within a C++ program is an objects
  ## Principles's of OOP :
    1. Encapsulation : Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, 
    so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object. Encapsulation can 
    be used to hide both data members and data functions or methods associated with an instantiated class 
    or object.

    2.Abstraction : Abstraction in OOPS is used to hide unnecessary information and display only necessary 
    information to the users interacting. It is essential to represent real-world objects in a simplified 
    manner for users to interact easily

    3.Inheritance : Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors 
    from another class. It is a fundamental concept in OOP that promotes code reuse and establishes 
    relationships between classes

    4.Polymorphism : Polymorphism is one of the core concepts in OOP languages and describes the concept
    of using different classes with the same interface. In other words, It is the ability of objects to 
    take on different forms or behave in different ways depending on the context in which they are used.

  ## Two Types of objects exists :
    - Fields: Store Data
    - Procedure: Store code
    

  ## Args vs Kwargs
    - Args : It is stands for arguments that are passed to the function
    - Kwagrs : It stands for keyword arguments which are passed along with the values into the functions
