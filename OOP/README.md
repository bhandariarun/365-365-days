# About Object Oriented Paradigm(OOP)

  ## Principles's of OOP :
    1. Encapsulation : Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, 
    so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object. Encapsulation can 
    be used to hide both data members and data functions or methods associated with an instantiated class 
    or object.
